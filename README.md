## cobalt api
cobalt has an open api that you can use in your projects *for free~*. it's easy and straightforward to use, [check out the docs](/docs/api.md) to learn how to use it. 

✅ you can use the main api instance ([api.cobalt.tools](https://api.cobalt.tools/)) in your **personal** projects.  
❌ you cannot use the free api commercially (anywhere that's gated behind paywalls or ads). host your own instance for this.

we reserve the right to restrict abusive/excessive access to the main instance api.

## how to run your own instance
if you want to run your own instance for whatever purpose, [follow this guide](/docs/run-an-instance.md).  
it's *highly* recommended to use a docker compose method unless you run for developing/debugging purposes.

## partners 
cobalt is sponsored by [royalehosting.net](https://royalehosting.net/?partner=cobalt), all main instances are currently hosted on their network :)
